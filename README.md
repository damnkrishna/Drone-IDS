# 🚁 Drone Intrusion Detection System with 3D Demonstration

A comprehensive **Drone Intrusion Detection & Prevention System (IDS/IPS)** using **ArduPilot SITL + QGroundControl**, with real-time attack simulation, telemetry logging, anomaly detection, and automated defense mechanisms.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how drones can be protected from malicious intrusions in a simulated environment. It combines **simulation, attack emulation, real-time visualization, machine learning, and automated defense strategies** to build a complete intrusion detection system for drones.

## 🔧 Project Components

### 1. Observation of Drone Behaviour

* **ArduPilot SITL** simulates drone hardware (GPS, motors, sensors).
* **QGroundControl** provides telemetry, maps, altitude, and control.
* Observe drone responses to commands in **2D/3D visualization** without real hardware.

### 2. Manipulation & Attack Simulation

* Simulate both **legitimate user commands** and **malicious intrusions**.
* Attack vectors:

  * Spoofed commands.
  * Command delay/replay.
  * Unauthorized takeover attempts.

### 3. Real-time Visualization of Attacks

* Attacks cause visible effects in QGroundControl: jerks, crashes, abnormal route changes.
* All telemetry is logged for further analysis.

### 4. Training ML Model

* Telemetry data is stored, preprocessed, and fed into ML pipelines.
* Models are trained to **predict anomalies** in real drone operations.

### 5. Response / Defense System

* Monitor MAVLink traffic for anomalies.
* ML model detects malicious commands.
* Automated defense system:

  * Temporary block (2 minutes).
  * Permanent block if persistent.
* Logs and defense events are visualized in real time.
